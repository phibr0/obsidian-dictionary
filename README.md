## Offline Dictionary

As of Release 2.13.0 this Plugin has experimental offline Support for English and Chinese. The offline Dictionary is pretty big (about 35 megabytes), which is why it's not bundled with this Plugin by default. It will download the neccessary files **when you are using it for the first time**. That means your first look-up still requires an internet connection.

## How to install

1. Go to **Community Plugins** in your [Obsidian](https://www.obsidian.md) Settings and **disable** Safe Mode
2. Click on **Browse** and search for “Obsidian Dictionary”
3. Click install
4. Toggle the Plugin on in the **Community Plugins** Tab

## Privacy

This Plugin relies on third-party [API's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API) to find Definitions, Synonyms, etc. You can select from a Range of API’s and choose which one to trust, the Plugin will not make requests to API’s you didn’t allow it to. To find more Information about the different API’s click the “More Info“ Button in the Settings.

If you explicitly activate the **Advanced Synonym Search**, there will be one additional API Call to analyze the *whole* Sentence the selected Word appears in. This will make the suggested Synonyms more accurate based on the context.

Even though this Plugin is fully Open-Source and thus can be looked over by anyone, the third-party API’s might not be.

## How to make this Plugin better

### Translations

If you want to help and translate this Plugin to new languages, see [locales](https://github.com/phibr0/obsidian-dictionary/tree/master/src/l10n/locale).

### New API's

This Plugin is meant to be easily extensible! If you want to add a new API for a new (or already supported) Language see: [API Manager](src/apiManager.ts).

You will need to create a new class for the new API, which implements [DefinitionProvider](src/api/types.ts) or [SynonymProvider](src/api/types.ts) (or both).

If the Language you are working with doesn't exist yet, add it to the `LANGUAGES` in [_constants.ts](src/_constants.ts).

After that, add the API to the respective List in the [API Manager](src/apiManager.ts) and finally open a Pull Request here on GitHub.
This will automatically make it selectable in the Settings.

## Variables

You can edit the Note Template for your local Dictionary in the Settings. Here is a List of Variables you can use:

- `{{notice}}` → "Autogenerated by Obsidian Dictionary" (Localized)
- `{{word}}` → The Word the File is created for
- `{{pronunciationHeader}}` → "Pronunciations" (Localized)
